                  expert guidance on how to organize and manage open
                  source projects using the Internet as a
                  collaboration tool. With the help of several
                  fascinating and instructive case studies, Sandred
                  explores practical concerns such as building,
                  motivating, and managing virtual teams; structuring

                  and development to date. With an eye for the social
                  constructs that shaped the Internet, she explores
                  the Cold War genesis of ARPANET, created by the
                  Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects
                  Agency, and its technological successors. Abbate
                  makes much of the military origins of the earliest
                  computer networks and of issues surrounding
                  packet-switching technology. She considers major
                  players--not just institutions but people like Paul
                  Baran, Robert Kahn, Vinton Cerf, Lawrence Roberts,
                  and Donald Davies--and pays special attention to the
                  astonishing way in which ARPANET eventually
                  metamorphosed into an egalitarian paradigm of
                  commercial and civilian interaction by the
                  1990s. Though the constant use of parenthetical
                  notation is distracting, and a much-needed glossary
                  is sadly omitted, this book is useful for anyone
                  studying information technology. Recommended for all
                  public and academic libraries.--Dayne Sherman,

  Abstract =	 {When confronted with new uses of copyrighted works,
                  courts assessing fair use claims face a difficult
                  problem in examining the fourth fair use factor the
                  potential effect of the infringing use upon the
                  market for the copyrighted work. A determination
                  that the copyright holder's interest has been harmed
                  implicitly requires a finding that there is a market
                  for the use, and that the holder has a right to
                  prevent unpermitted uses. Often, the very existence
                  of such a market is at issue. In this context, a
                  court's denial of fair use may in effect award a new
                  market to the copyright holder to exploit. Although
                  the determination of whether a new market should
                  belong to a copyright holder is integral to
                  preserving copyright's constitutionally mandated
                  balance between authors and the public, neither the
                  fair use statute nor Supreme Court precedent
                  provides clear standards. As a result, courts have
                  had to strike out on their own. This Comment argues
                  that courts, overly influenced by the market failure
                  theory of fair use and misled by licensing evidence,
                  have failed to distinguish between uses that should
                  be paid for and uses that merely can be paid
                  for. Finally, this Comment suggests several methods
                  of reforming fair use analysis of the market effect
                  factor and concludes that, ultimately, Congress may
                  be better suited to presenting copyright's
                  constitutional balance than are the courts.},

                  employed to capture personally identifiable
                  information, privacy concerns have intensified. To
                  analyze these matters more systematically, ideas
                  about human identities that have been implicit in
                  the development of economics and computer science
                  are considered here. The two fields have evolved
                  along parallel tracks, starting with an assumption
                  of perfect transparency and moving toward a more
                  sophisticated appreciation of individuals' private
                  informational states. Progress in the analysis and
                  resolution of privacy problems will require that
                  this evolution be taken seriously and continued. 95

                  created tremendous interest in digital libraries and
                  electronic publishing. This book is the first to
                  provide an integrated overview of the field,
                  including a historical perspective, a survey of the
                  state of the art, and an examination of current
                  research. The term "digital libraries" covers the
                  creation and the distribution over networks of all
                  types of information, ranging from converted
                  historical materials to kinds of information that
                  have no analogues in the physical world. In some
                  ways digital libraries and traditional libraries are
                  very different, yet in other ways they are
                  remarkably similar. People still create information
                  that has to be organized, stored, and distributed,
                  and they still need to find and use information that
                  others have created. An underlying theme of this
                  book is that no aspect of digital libraries can be
                  understood in isolation or without attention to the
                  needs of the people who create and use
                  information. Although the book covers a wide range
                  of technical, economic, social, and organizational
                  topics, its focus is on the actual working
                  components of a digital library. }

                  edition explores the topics of the machine-space
                  merger, the machine-body merger, and cyberpunk
                  fiction. Schroeder offers a detailed and informative
                  examination of the limits of current virtual reality
                  techniques. Shield's mixed collection of essays
                  digresses from its theme of "living bodies" and
                  "real histories" to get lost in theory. Porter's
                  edition provides an excellent critical and empirical
                  exploration of the Internet community. 3

  Abstract =	 {The emergence of a new communications infrastructure
                  based on technology is discussed, looking at how it
                  replaced the previous transportation-based
                  infrastructure and at the rapid rate of its
                  advance. A history of the Internet and related
                  communication technologies is provided, with
                  attention to how, although the Internet seems
                  worldwide, it is limited to countries with
                  preexisting structures like telephone systems, and
                  how the Internet is beginning to merge with tv and
                  telephone systems, despite starting out separated
                  from them. How the use of the Internet has shifted
                  from a business to a consumer context is also
                  addressed. It is held that modern technology may
                  best be understood in the form of a map and its
                  trajectories (which are presented), covering the
                  historical distinctions of technology, the sources
                  of change, the outcome for products, the character
                  of change, and the underlying trajectories of
                  technology. The Internet's relationship with the
                  "consumer ladder" is detailed, and it is argued that
                  the Internet has greatly expanded the number of
                  people who move up and down this ladder. 5

  Abstract =	 {Our society increasingly perceives information as an
                  owned commodity. Professor Benkler demonstrates that
                  laws born of this conception are removing uses of
                  information from the public domain and placing them
                  in an enclosed domain where they are subject to an
                  owner's Exclusive control. Professor Benkler argues
                  that the enclosure movement poses a risk to the
                  diversity of information sources in our information
                  environment and abridges the freedom of speech. He
                  then examines three laws at the center of this
                  movement: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the
                  proposed Article 2B of the Uniform Commercial Code,
                  and the Collections of Information Antipiracy
                  Act. Each member of this trio, Professor Benkler
                  concludes, presents troubling challenges to First

  Abstract =	 {In the late 1990s, use of either of the words
                  'childhood' or 'Internet' is enough to signify at a
                  stroke many of society's contemporary hopes and
                  fears about what it means to be modern. By providing
                  a critical review of the burgeoning (popular,
                  policy, and-academic) literature that is emerging as
                  debates about 'childhood' and 'the Internet' take
                  centre stage in the ongoing struggle to define the
                  future of our 'virtual geographies: what we seek to
                  do in this paper is to unpack some of the
                  assumptions that underpin both terms. Specifically,
                  we argue that there is now a dominant story in
                  circulation concerning what has been called the rise
                  of a 'digital generation: albeit one, as we show,
                  that can be read in two diametrically opposed
                  ways. In the central part of the paper, by
                  characterising the Internet as the latest in a long
                  line of 'frontier' technologies, we identify three
                  senses (in terms of time,in terms of space, and in
                  terms of competence) in which this dominant story
                  acts to construct discursively the cyberspace opened
                  up by computer-mediated communication as distinct
                  from the 'here and now'. For all its seductiveness,
                  however, we propose that this discourse is not
                  adequate to describe the complexities of what
                  particular children might actually do with
                  particular Internet-based tools in particular
                  settings. By drawing on a variety of work (from both
                  within and outside of the discipline) which has
                  begun to open up the undifferentiated categories
                  'children' and 'technology' on which simplistic
                  notions of a cohort of 'cyberkids' are based, we
                  conclude the paper with some preliminary ideas about
                  how we might be able to offer more nuanced accounts
                  of being connected.},

                  available documents raised questions about what
                  should be considered a ``document.'' The answer is
                  important for any definition of the scope of
                  information Science. Paul Otlet and others developed
                  a functional view of ``document'' and discussed
                  whether, for example, sculpture, museum objects, and
                  live animals, could be considered ``document.''
                  Suzanne Briet equated ``document'' with organized
                  physical evidence. These ideas appear to resemble
                  notions of ``material culture'' in cultural
                  anthropology and ``object-as-sign'' in semiotics,

                  "categorical identities" than they do dense,

                  and an emphasis on community needs to be
                  complemented by more direct attention to the social
                  bases of discursive publics that engage people
                  across lines of basic difference in collective

                  they also make it easy for relatively ephemeral
                  protest activity to outstrip organizational
                  roots. Further, they encourage governments to avoid
                  concentrating their power in specific spatial
                  locations and thus make revolution in some ways more

  Abstract =	 {Explores the ontology of digital domains and their
                  politics, drawing on a variety of secondary
                  literature. The notion that cyberspace is best
                  understood in spatial terms is criticized because it
                  tends to privilege a single, spatial ontology that
                  unduly narrows the multitude of potential
                  configurations of digital domains. The essence of
                  computer networks is the fact that they enable
                  instant retrieval and processing of encoded signs,
                  rather than reproduce space. Cyberspace is
                  understood as an invocational domain in which data
                  may be invoked through simple commands. Thus, the
                  ontology of the digital domain is made up of the
                  multiple ways in which addressability is made
                  possible. Drawing on the work of Martin Heidegger
                  (1977), it is argued that the significance of this
                  invocational ontology of the digital domain lies in
                  the fact that it requires rearrangement of the
                  culture and society around it. That which cannot be
                  invoked in the digital domain falls outside its
                  purview. To the extent that digital domains encroach
                  on larger areas of social life, aspects of society
                  not encodable begin to drop out of the ontology of
                  the real world. 23 References. D. Ryfe},

                  history. But as Erik Davis explains, religious
                  impulses and magicaldreams permeate the history of
                  technology. Ranging from the printing press to the
                  telegraph, from radio to the Internet, David peels
                  away the utilitarian shell of technology to reveal
                  the mystical and millennialist fervor that attends
                  each new communications breakthrough. As he unveils
                  the hidden history oftechno-mysticism, Davis shows
                  how the religious imagination continues to feed the
                  utopian dreams, apocalyptic visions, and alien
                  obsessions that populate today's technological
                  unconscious. In these pages, Davis offers a lucid,
                  playful, and astonishingly erudite journey through
                  our hyper-mediatedenvironment. Anyone grappling with
                  the morphing boundaries and terminal speed of our
                  present moment will want to take the
                  ride. (Publisher.)}

  Abstract =	 {Examines fears related to the Internet that have
                  prompted demands for regulation on behalf of
                  "vulnerable" women and children. It is argued that
                  frightening misconceptions have prevented many women
                  from discovering resources available on the Net, and
                  have set the stage for a politics of regulation,
                  repression, and authority. Tech-anxiety, seen as a
                  product of "containment culture" that has
                  transferred fear of communism to fear of new
                  ideas/technology, mirrors current widespread
                  cultural uncertainty. Net sprawl has also created
                  demands for an authority to determine what is
                  credible in the information overload and establish a
                  foundation for truth to prevent
                  manipulation/deception that could ultimately be
                  destructive to democracy. Exploration of the link
                  between credibility and authority indicates that
                  cyberspace is a potential arena for political
                  battles over what is real involving both progressive
                  causes and those of subversive right-wing
                  groups. However, it is contended that a struggle
                  over credibility and authorization is far superior
                  to regulatory interventions that would privilege
                  some elements at the expense of others. 15

                  director of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science,
                  Dertouzos presents a realistic view of where current
                  technology is headed, but without all of the
                  distracting hype. He conveys his technical
                  predictions in an accessible writing style, which
                  makes the weighty subject matter read more like a
                  novel, appealing to a nontechie audience. In
                  addition, Dertouzos sprinkles vignettes of the
                  future throughout the text to help readers envision
                  technologies that have yet to be introduced. Imagine
                  using a personal network called a "bodynet," to talk
                  on the phone, watch TV, read e-mail, and take
                  pictures from wherever you are. In our workplaces,
                  future innovations will increase productivity:
                  Employees in different locations will be able to do
                  groupwork together and order merchandise from around
                  the world via e-forms. Our governments will link to
                  a world network to engage in issues of diplomacy,
                  trade, tourism, and more. For newcomers, the book
                  provides a brief history of the field of information
                  technology and explains the most current advances in
                  technology. What Will Be also unveils many upcoming
                  technologies in the Information Marketplace that
                  will transform our lives. Because the author is an
                  expert in information technology, he is naturally
                  enthusiastic about the inventions that new
                  technology will bring. It is only in the last
                  portion that Dertouzos addresses some of the
                  humanist concerns over emerging technologies, such
                  as information overload and a greater disparity
                  between rich and poor. (AZ)}

                  and ``technopagans'' who use the personal computer
                  in New Age mystical rituals via echomail, a
                  technology that links discussion groups into a
                  communal conference. California roboticist Mark
                  Pauline stages spectacles in which robots and humans
                  are menaced by heavy machinery or remote-controlled
                  weaponry, while Chico MacMurtrie's puppet-like robot
                  musicians, acrobats and warriors enact ecotopian
                  dramas. Australian cybernetic body artist Stelarc,
                  plastered with electrodes and trailing wires,
                  embodies the human/machine hybrid all of us are
                  metaphorically becoming. Dery also profiles online
                  swingers hooked on virtual sex, cyberpunk rockers,
                  cyberpunk novelist William Gibson and
                  D.A. Therrien's performance ensemble Comfort/

                  autonomy of intelligent machines and the nightmare
                  of humanity's obsolescence. Dery closes this
                  adventurous inquiry with an appraisal of the
                  ``posthumanist'' visions of novelist William
                  Burroughs, techno-mystical SF author Vernor Vinge

  Abstract =	 {Over the past two decades, an economic
                  interpretation of copyright law's fair-use doctrine
                  has taken hold in court decisions and academic
                  discourse. This interpretation posits that fair use
                  exists in large part to counteract economic
                  imperfections that prevent smooth functioning of the
                  copyright marketplace. Recently, commentators
                  focusing on this type of analysis have predicted a
                  drastically reduced future for fair use in digital
                  media such as the Internet. The Clinton
                  Administration's task force on digital issues,
                  adopting these commentators' logic, has suggested
                  that fair use may be unnecessary when an owner can
                  license uses. This conclusion rests on the idea that
                  if an owner can license the use, then the market is
                  free of imperfections, and thus fair use is
                  unnecessary. The author agrees that the Internet
                  will markedly reduce many types of market
                  imperfections. The Internet grants owners the
                  ability to reach most users at very little
                  cost. However, the author argues that important
                  sources of market imperfection will continue to
                  implicate the core values that animate fair-use
                  policy. At base, the copyright framework must always
                  serve to maximize the public benefit from expressive
                  works. In the face of lingering bargaining casts,
                  externalities, or anti-dissemination motives, the
                  new medium does nothing to ensure that the parties
                  to a given bargain will act with the public's best
                  interest in mind. The author focuses on one type of
                  copying activity central to everyday use of the
                  internet: fragmented literal copying of very small
                  chunks of content The author concludes that,
                  notwithstanding copyright owners' ostensible ability
                  to license these uses cheaply, fair use remains an
                  essential tool to allow fragmented uses that will
                  further copyright's major policy goals.},

                  1990s. The multilayered, nonlinear, nonsequential,
                  graphic, interactive nature of digitized
                  communication and the affinity of children for it
                  are examined. Numerous examples of handheld
                  literature for youth reflecting these digital
                  influences are woven into the discussion. A new
                  framework for literary criticism and evaluation,
                  taking account of the radical changes in literature
                  for youth, is proposed. The author suggests that:
                  (1) those involved with criticism or evaluation of
                  children's literature will take account of the
                  constructs of radical change in order to employ an
                  appropriate holistic context for examination; (2)
                  children's increasing freedom from the dominance of
                  a limiting adult definition of their capabilities
                  will be reflected in how their handheld literature
                  is structured; (3) printed handheld literature will
                  continue to be calibrated to changes in the
                  digitized environment; and (4) further radical
                  changes in literature for youth will develop in a

                  case, African Americans who did not own a computer
                  used computers more often than whites who were
                  similarly situated. Thus, recent commentary

                  usage, caused by gaps in income levels, is

                  Americans use computers less often than whites in

                  trust among African Americans toward an invasive new

                  (traditional publisher vs. authoring

  Abstract =	 {Argues that, to understand the legitimacy of a
                  culture, its relation to the archives, ie, the site
                  for the accumulation of records, must be
                  investigated. Archive reason is concerned with the
                  particularity and singularity of the
                  event. Increasingly, the focus has shifted from
                  archiving the lives of the good and the great to
                  recording the details of mundane everyday life. The
                  problem then becomes not what to put into the
                  archives but what to leave out. Some of the
                  implications of these questions were considered by
                  Georg Simmel in his argument that there has been a
                  buildup and overload in the production and
                  circulation of objective culture that has exceeded
                  the individual's subjective capacity to assimilate
                  and order. In this way, the individual is confronted
                  with irresolvable dilemmas over selectivity, with
                  each particular choice amounting to a wager that
                  inevitably closes off others. Related questions
                  about the difficulties of handling cultural
                  completeness were also addressed by Borges. Yet
                  neither thinker could have anticipated the full
                  implications of the electronic archive: the
                  development of new technologies for storing,
                  searching, and communicating information through the
                  Internet via databases and hypertext links. The
                  electronic archive offers new possibilities for
                  speed, mobility, and completeness of access to
                  cultures that have become digitalized, raising
                  fundamental questions about ownership, intellectual
                  property rights, censorship, and democratic
                  access. It is contended that the new electronic
                  archives will change not only the form in which
                  culture is produced and recorded, but also the wider
                  conditions under which it is enacted and lived.},

  Abstract =	 {The rapid deployment of privacy-destroying
                  technologies by governments and businesses threatens
                  to make informational privacy obsolete. The first
                  part of this article describes a range of current
                  technologies to which the law has yet to respond
                  effectively. These include: routine collection of
                  transactional data, growing automated surveillance
                  in public places, deployment of facial recognition
                  technology and other biometrics, cell-phone
                  tracking, vehicle tracking, satellite monitoring,
                  workplace surveillance, Internet tracking from
                  cookies to "clicktrails," hardware-based
                  identifiers, intellectual property-protecting
                  "switchware," and sense- enhanced searches that
                  allow observers to see through everything from walls
                  to clothes. The cumulative and reinforcing effect of
                  these technologies may make modern life completely
                  visible and permeable to observers; there could be
                  nowhere to hide. The second part of this article
                  discusses leading attempts to craft legal responses
                  to the assault on privacy-including self-regulation,
                  privacy-enhancing technologies, data-protection law,
                  and property-rights based solutions-in the context
                  of three structural obstacles to privacy
                  enhancement: consumers' privacy myopia; important
                  First Amendment protection of rights to collect and
                  repeat information; and fear of what other people
                  may do if not monitored. The article concludes that
                  despite the warnings of information privacy
                  pessimists, all is not lost-yet.},

  Abstract =	 {Over the past two decades, as the presence of

                  ubiquitous, its tremendous capabilities of
                  reproduction and distribution have created difficult
                  issues for copyright law. Recently, Congress has
                  addressed some of these issues by taking the
                  nontraditional approach of directly regulating the
                  manufacture, development, and distribution of
                  technology. In 1992, Congress enacted the Audio Home
                  Recording Act, requiring that all digital audio
                  recording devices possess a serial copy management
                  system to limit the copying of digital music
                  recordings. Six years later, Congress passed the
                  Digital Millennium Copyright Act, making it a crime
                  to manufacture or distribute technologies for the
                  purpose of circumventing technological measures
                  taken by copyright owners to protect their
                  copyrights. This Comment examines copyright
                  regulation of technology by analyzing the relative
                  merits of these two statutes vis-a-vis the broader
                  goals of copyright law. It concludes that copyright
                  statutes can best regulate technology if they
                  designate a specific copyright protection system,
                  require technology manufacturers to incorporate the
                  protection system into their products, and identify
                  a rulemaking body to maintain the statutes'
                  effectiveness.},

                  cultural standards. While conceding that popular and
                  high culture have converged to some extent over the
                  twenty-five years since he wrote the book, Gans
                  holds that the choices of typical Ivy League

                  still very different from those of high school

                  result in the wholesale pirating of protected
                  works. Instead, technologies such as trusted systems
                  will enable copyright owners to exercise an
                  unprecedented degree of control over their
                  intangible property. Technological methods of
                  intellectual property protection are so powerful
                  that they threaten to supplant law where digital
                  works are concerned, undermining the utilitarian
                  balance of copyright and threatening free
                  expression. If this result is to be avoided, trusted
                  systems must be regulated in the public interest.},

  Journal =	 {Information, Communication and Society},
  Volume =	 {2},
  Number =	 {1},

  OPTNote =	 {Spring},
  Abstract =	 {Jeremy Bentham's (1791) panopticon has, courtesy of
                  Michel Foucault (1975), become a dominant metaphor
                  in surveillance studies. This central eye, aimed at
                  the moral reform of institutionalized bodies and
                  operating through a de facto closure of individual
                  agency, tends to limit the conception of the complex
                  ways surveillance serves and disrupts power. Via
                  analysis of commercial and workplace surveillance,
                  it is shown here that power is contested, and agency
                  is never completely closed down. To comprehend this
                  negotiated relationship, an alternative framework -
                  plague management - is presented. This envisions
                  surveillance in a social setting operated by
                  multiple agents who themselves are open to the gaze
                  of those surveyed. The aim of this project is to
                  categorize rather than to reform and cure, and,
                  moreover, space is available for resistance. On the
                  global scale, new technologies have opened space for
                  informal, local surveillances to be effectively
                  linked to media and Internet audiences. These
                  surveillance networks, informal alliances of a
                  variety of actors, have the potential to radically
                  alter orthodox relations of power by evading the
                  information controls of the state and connecting a
                  local gaze with the global community. It is
                  concluded that, although surveillance studies has
                  rightly been concerned with the control capacities
                  of information technology, a balance must be
                  actively sought with the facilitative, enabling, and
                  even democratic impulses nascent in the new

                  artists, designers, academics, software developers,
                  and researchers-and it gives them all the
                  information they need to protect, manage, and profit
                  from their intellectual property (IP). In clear,
                  non-technical language, Harris explains the
                  tremendous value of IP and demonstrates how these
                  same principles for instance, have made David
                  Sarnoff (who introduced television into our homes)
                  and Bill Gates (Microsoft) fantasticaly successful
                  in their respective fields. Until recently,
                  intellectual property existed primarily in the form
                  of books, newspapers, magazines, sound recordings,
                  paintings, and films. Although media is now moving
                  from a print and analog-based format to digital,
                  many of the same concerns remain. Owners of new
                  forms of IP, including computer software and
                  CD-ROMs, as well as text, images, animation, audio
                  and film clips on the Internet, want to control and
                  to be paid for the use of their work. With
                  traditional media, however, it's difficult to
                  monitor unauthorized uses. "Stealing" intellectual
                  property when it is used on-line. Lesley Harris,
                  well known for her championing of IP rights, and who
                  coined the phrase "Digital Property," also explains
                  the ins and outs of copyright law, as well as how to
                  profit from various web-based business models
                  including: consignment, commission, revenue-sharing,
                  flat fee, advertising, transaction fees, pay per

                  policies and practices of scholarly journals on
                  evaluating manuscripts for publication that had been
                  previously published electronically. Various
                  electronic forms were considered: a manuscript
                  having been e-mailed to members of a listserv,
                  attached to a personal or institutional home page,
                  stored in an electronic preprint collection, or
                  published in an electronic proceedings or electronic
                  journal. Factors that might affect the consideration
                  of such manuscripts were also examined, including
                  characteristics of the journal, the previously
                  published work, and the submitted manuscript. A
                  sample of 202 scholarly journals in the sciences,
                  social sciences, and arts and humanities was
                  selected for study. A questionnaire and cover
                  letters were sent to the journal editors in the
                  summer and fall of 1997, with an overall return rate
                  of 57.4\%. Results are reported for all journals,
                  with comparisons being made between journals edited
                  in the Unites States and outside the Unites States,
                  by journal impact factor, and by discipline. The
                  findings suggest that editorial policies regarding
                  prior electronic publication are in an early stage
                  of development. Most journal editors do not have a
                  formal policy regarding the evaluation of work
                  previously published in electronic form, nor are
                  they currently evaluating such a policy. Editors
                  disagreed widely on the importance of the various
                  factors that might affect their decision to consider
                  a work previously published electronically. The form
                  or type of prior electronic publication was an
                  important variable. Although some editors currently
                  have a fairly rigid and negative posture towards
                  work previously published electronically, most are
                  willing to consider certain forms of such work for
                  publication in their journals. Probably the most
                  significant results of the study were the many
                  differences in practices among scholarly
                  disciplines. The findings of this study reveal how
                  the internet and the World Wide Web are currently
                  affecting manuscript consideration policies of
                  scholarly journals at this early stage of Web and

                  in terms of adjustments that a TV-dominated culture
                  must make in a society that includes Internet
                  communications. The investigation finds that the
                  Internet will modify tv communications by (1)
                  reducing the anonymity of people and their
                  communications, (2) increasing the storage of and
                  access to information, and (3) affording any
                  individual the possibility of controlling the
                  recovery and dissemination of communications. The
                  Internet expands individual freedom and capability
                  to communicate, which results in greater news
                  gathering and interpretive communication among the
                  masses. Because the Internet is substantially
                  different from tv, its influence will be
                  massive. Increased specialization, fragmentation,
                  individualization, and decentralization of societal
                  activity will cause stress to social, economic, and
                  political institutions. Eventually, society will
                  adjust to the new communications culture, but it
                  will be a substantially different society from one
                  dominated by tv. 40 References. Adapted from the

                  accessible slice of contemporary cultural history
                  has a whiff of paradox about it: what can it mean,
                  exactly, to say that we humans have become something
                  other than human? The answer, Katherine Hayles
                  explains, lies not in ourselves but in our
                  tools. Ever since the invention of electronic
                  computers five decades ago, these powerful new
                  machines have inspired a shift in how we define
                  ourselves both as individuals and as a
                  species. Hayles tracks this shift across the history
                  of avant-garde computer theory, starting with
                  Norbert Weiner and other early ``cyberneticists,''
                  who were the first to systematically explore the
                  similarities between living and computing
                  systems. Hayles's study ends with artificial-life
                  specialists, many of whom no longer even bother to
                  distinguish between life forms and computers. Along
                  the way she shows these thinkers struggling to
                  reconcile their traditional, Western notions of
                  human identity with the unsettling, cyborg
                  directions in which their own work seems to be
                  leading humanity. This is more than just the story
                  of a geek elite, however. Hayles looks at
                  cybernetically inspired science fiction by the likes
                  of Philip K. Dick, William Gibson, and Neal
                  Stephenson to show how the larger culture grapples
                  with the same issues that dog the technologists. She
                  also draws lucidly on her own broad grasp of
                  contemporary philosophy both to contextualize those
                  issues and to contend with them herself. The result
                  is a fascinating introduction--and a valuable
                  addition--to one of the most important currents in
                  recent intellectual history. (AZ, Julian Dibbell)},

                  for Economic Cooperation and Development data. Three
                  major results flow from the analysis: (1) The
                  information revolution is still very much in its
                  beginning stages. Few workers are employed directly
                  in computing, and revenues from the industry
                  contribute only marginally to each country's
                  economy. Although there is a sizeable information
                  technology (it) infrastructure in place, just a
                  small fraction of the general populace actually uses
                  computers, and fewer are connected to the
                  Internet. (2) The information revolution is largely
                  concentrated in the g-7 countries: only 5 of them
                  account for 80\% of the it market. (3) Analysis of
                  the Internet reveals that it is overwhelmingly
                  US-based, English-speaking, and
                  Western-focused. Thus, the information revolution
                  could presage the rapid and widespread transmission
                  of information in a culture-laden, asymmetrical
                  way. A call is made for international dialogue on
                  how it could be introduced in culturally harmonious
                  ways. 7 Tables, 24 References. Adapted from the

                  commercial development of the World Wide Web is the
                  current lack of consumer trust in this new
                  commercial medium. This lack of trust is engendered
                  primarily by the industry's documented failure to
                  respond satisfactorily to mounting consumer concerns
                  over information privacy in electronic, networked
                  environments. How such concerns are affecting the
                  growth and development of consumer-oriented
                  commercial activity on the Web is examined, along
                  with implications for potential industry
                  response. In the short run, the commercial
                  development of the Web depends on giving consumers
                  the opportunity to be anonymous when engaging in
                  information exchanges and online
                  transactions. Ultimately, however, commercial Web
                  providers must come to realize that the Internet
                  dramatically shifts the balance of power between a
                  business and its customers, and therefore, radical
                  new business strategies will be required for
                  long-term success. Because the Web offers
                  unprecedented opportunities for interacting with
                  customers, strategies that take advantage of the
                  medium's unique features are likely to reap
                  important rewards in customer satisfaction, loyalty,
                  and retention. Therefore, in the long run, the most
                  effective way for commercial Web providers to
                  develop profitable exchange relationships with
                  online customers is to gain consumer trust by
                  allowing the balance of power to shift toward more
                  cooperative interactions.},

                  tours the digital avant-garde: virtual cities where
                  Web surfers hyperlink and cyber cafes where avatars

                  technology is nonlinear, Holtzman reminds the

                  end, but a way out is offered through hyperlinks
                  that allow users to direct their own path through

                  world--pixelated images, flat textures, finite
                  CD-ROM speeds, and so on. Nonetheless, he foresees

                  protection for electronically disseminated works on
                  an open network such as the Internet. The author
                  points out that worldwide networks are potentially
                  very powerful and inexpensive publishing tools,
                  though many copyright holders are still afraid to
                  disseminate their works electronically for fear of
                  massive infringement taking place outside the
                  jurisdiction of U.S. courts. The author argues,
                  however, that it is not accurate to describe
                  cyberspace as an entirely ``lawless land'' where
                  copyright infringers can act anonymously. Though he
                  agrees with many commentators that ideally national
                  copyright laws will need to be harmonized, e.g.,
                  through the multilateral process already initiated
                  under the authority of the World Intellectual
                  Property Organization, the author argues that even
                  today contract law provides copyright owners with
                  some viable ways to protect their intellectual
                  property in cyberspace. He proposes a number of
                  steps that they can take so as to create binding
                  contracts with potential infringers willing to
                  acquire the copyrighted works on-line throughout the
                  world. Such an agreement would provide sufficient
                  protection and would constitute the foundation for
                  acquiring royalties. While discussing transnational
                  aspects of cross-border dissemination of electronic
                  works, the author analyzes also the drafting process
                  of the new art. 2B U.C.C. (licenses) and the limits
                  of state contract law in the light of federal
                  copyright protection in the U.S. Finally, he points
                  out that no legal protection, by statute,
                  multilateral treaty or contract, is secure unless
                  some kind of cryptography is used for the
                  transmitted works.},

                  of artistic innovation. With Interface Culture,
                  Johnson charts the vital role interface design plays
                  in modern society. Just as the great novels of
                  Melville, Dickens, and Zola explained a rapidly
                  industrializing society to itself, he argues, Web
                  sites, Microsoft Bob, flying toasters, and the
                  landscapes of video games tell the digital society
                  how to imagine itself and how to get around in
                  cyberspace's unfamiliar realm. The role once played
                  by novelists is now fulfilled by the interface
                  designer, who has bridged the gap between technology
                  and everyday life by providing a conceptual
                  framework for the vast amounts of information and
                  computation that surround us. Johnson explores the
                  past, throwing light on the modern interface's
                  roots. From the great cathedrals of the Middle Ages
                  to the rise of perspective drawing in the
                  Renaissance, from Enlightenment satire to the golden
                  age of television, Interface Culture uses a wealth
                  of venerable ``interface innovation'' to place
                  newfangled creations like Windows 95 and the Web in
                  a rich historical context. Interface Culture also
                  looks at the future - from what PC screens will look
                  like in ten years to how new interfaces will alter
                  the style of our conversation, prose, and
                  thoughts. (Adapted from Publisher.)},

  Abstract =	 {To date, most inquiries into race and cyberspace
                  have focused; on the "digital divide" - whether
                  racial minorities have access to advanced
                  computing-communication technologies. This paper
                  asks a more fundamental question: Can cyberspace
                  change the way that race functions in American
                  society? Professor Jerry Kang starts his analysis
                  with a social-cognitive account of American racial
                  mechanics that centers the role of racial
                  schemers. These schemes consist of racial
                  categories, rules of racial mapping that place
                  individuals into these categories, and racial
                  meanings associated with each category. Ne argues
                  that cyberspace can disrupt racial schemas because
                  it alters the architecture of both identity
                  presentation (enabling racial anonymity and
                  pseudonymity) and social interaction (enabling
                  increased interracial interactions). Thus,
                  cyberspace presents society with three design
                  options: abolition, which challenges racial mapping
                  by promoting racial anonymity; integration, which
                  reforms racial meanings by promoting interracial
                  social interaction; and transmutation, which
                  disrupts the very notion of fixed racial categories
                  by promoting racial pseudonymity (or
                  "cyber-passing"). After analyzing each option's
                  merits, Professor Kang concludes that society need
                  not adopt a single, uniform design strategy for all
                  of cyberspace. Instead, society can embrace a policy
                  of digital diversification, which explicitly zones
                  different cyber spaces according to different racial
                  environments. For example, most market places could
                  be zoned abolition, whereas mast social spaces could
                  be zoned integration. By encouraging: a diversified
                  policy portfolio, society can exploit synergies
                  created by flexible zoning while avoiding policy
                  lock-in. Although cyberspace is no panacea for the
                  racial conflicts and inequality that persist, it
                  offers new, possibilities for furthering racial
                  justice that should not be wasted.},

                  regarding what should be accepted as facts. These
                  technologies provide a level playing field - it is
                  no longer the case that those with the most massive
                  resources will have the biggest audience. Indeed,
                  many small sites command huge followings. The
                  Internet and the Web allow for quick dissemination
                  of information, both false and true; unlike
                  newspapers and other media outlets, there are often
                  no quality control mechanisms on Web sites that
                  would permit users to know what information is
                  generally recognized fact and what is spurious. On
                  the Internet and the Web, facts more easily escape
                  from their creator's or owner's control and, once
                  unleashed, can be bandied about. Groups that wish to
                  control what is perceived as fact will find the
                  Internet a threat. Those groups that hail
                  competition between outlooks will welcome what the
                  Web hath wrought. 3 References. Adapted from the

  Abstract =	 {Political theorists like Alexis de Tocqueville have
                  long recognized the importance of citizen
                  associations for the practice of democracy. Through
                  participation in associations, citizens both receive
                  an education in public affairs and create centers of
                  political power independent of the state. Essential
                  to participation in an association is participation
                  in a forum, a communication space that allows for
                  many-to-many communication in which citizens can
                  "treat of public affairs in public" (Tocqueville,
                  1945 edition). Participation in forums suffers from
                  numerous barriers, however, eg, the need to meet in
                  one common place, the need to meet at one common
                  time, and the potentially high costs of
                  participation. Online Internet forums avoid many of
                  these barriers, and, thus, they hold the promise of
                  facilitating the formation and operation of citizen
                  associations. This was confirmed in 1995 by the
                  experiences of a Boston (MA)-based citizen
                  association, the Telecommunication Policy
                  Roundtable-Northeast (tpr-ne). TPR-NE's uses of the
                  Internet suggest that online forums may allow
                  associations to be more responsive, robust, and able
                  to unite more members. 37 References. Adapted from

  Abstract =	 {Preliminary injunctions against libel, obscenity,
                  and other kinds of speech are generally considered
                  unconstitutional prior restraints. Even though libel
                  may inflict truly irreparable harm on its victim,
                  the most a libel plaintiff can hope for is damages,
                  or perhaps a permanent injunction after final
                  adjudication, not preliminary relief: Professors
                  Lemley and Volokh argue the same rule should apply
                  to preliminary injunctions in many copyright,
                  trademark, right of publicity, and trade secret
                  cases. They note that intellectual property rights,
                  unlike other property rights, are a form of content-
                  based, government-imposed speech restriction. The
                  mere fact that the restriction is denominated a
                  "property right" should not exempt it from
                  conventional First Amendment scrutiny, or justify
                  government action that restricts speech which
                  ultimately proves to be constitutionally
                  protected. This is especially so because in most
                  cases, damages would be a relatively effective
                  remedy. The Court's prior restraint doctrine and
                  sound First Amendment policy suggest that
                  preliminary injunctions in intellectual property
                  cases are often (though not always)
                  unconstitutional.},

  Abstract =	 {Proposed Uniform Commercial Code Article 2B, which
                  would govern transactions in information, would
                  remake the law of intellectual property licensing in
                  a radical way. But federal and state intellectual
                  property laws and policies impose significant limits
                  on the ability of states to change the rules of
                  intellectual property licensing by contract law. One
                  such limit is preemption, but preemption is unlikely
                  to provide significant protection for the
                  established rules of intellectual property
                  law. Several other doctrines will limit the ability
                  of parties to set their terms by contract, even in
                  the Article 2B world. The first is copyright misuse,
                  which has been applied against restrictive licensing
                  provisions. The second set of doctrines provides
                  that a number of licensing rules are decided as
                  questions of federal, not state, Law. The third set
                  of doctrines is a number of state public policies
                  that cannot be overridden by contract. Taken
                  together, these doctrines create a patchwork public
                  policy of intellectual property law that Article 2B
                  cannot alter.},

                  Internet as an uncontrollable, organic entity on its
                  head, and explores the architecture and social
                  systems that are changing every day and taming the
                  frontier. Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace is his
                  well-reasoned, undeniably cogent series of arguments
                  for guiding the still-evolving regulatory processes,
                  to ensure that we don't find ourselves stuck with a
                  system that we find objectionable. As the former
                  Communist-bloc countries found, a constitution is
                  still one of our best guarantees against the dark
                  side of chaos; and Lessig promotes a kind of
                  document that accepts the inevitable regulatory
                  authority of both government and commerce, while
                  constraining them within values that we hold by
                  consensus. Lessig holds that those who shriek the
                  loudest at the thought of interference in
                  cyberdoings, especially at the hands of the
                  government, are blind to the ever-increasing
                  regulation of the Net (admittedly, without badges or
                  guns) by businesses that find little opposition to
                  their schemes from consumers, competitors, or
                  cops. The Internet will be regulated, he says, and
                  our window of opportunity to influence the design of
                  those regulations narrows each day. How will we make
                  the decisions that the Framers of our paper-and-ink
                  Constitution couldn't foresee, much less resolve?

                  Cyberspace, constitutional scholar and former
                  Industry Standard columnist Lessig offered a wary
                  assessment of both the burgeoning architecture of
                  the Internet and the work of those seeking to
                  control its growth. In this sprawling follow-up,
                  Lessig takes his arguments in Code to the next
                  level. Warning of a digital future that, despite all
                  its promise, could in fact turn out quite darkly,
                  Lessig argues that while most of the world is still
                  pondering a digital revolution, a counterrevolution
                  is already underway. Programmers are closing off
                  Internet innovation through code. And lawmakers,
                  lobbied by entrenched commercial interests, are
                  applying overly broad interpretations of copyright
                  and intellectual property laws. To fully realize the
                  cultural and economic benefits of our technological
                  revolution, Lessig urges the creation of a public
                  "commons" for the Internet, an open system that
                  would allow for quicker exchange of intellectual
                  capital and offer future innovators the ability to
                  freely build upon the innovations of others. Some of
                  Lessig's sweeping proposals are sure to spark a
                  lively debate, but his well-reasoned, clearly
                  written argument is powerful. If we fail to deal
                  appropriately and immediately with the intellectual,
                  legal, cultural and economic issues associated with
                  rapid technological change, Lessig asserts, we risk
                  not only squandering the promise of the digital
                  future, but reverting to "a dark age" of increased
                  corporate and government control. [Publisher's

                  services will open. Creating, identifying and
                  protecting the information market space is a
                  critical component to the success of information
                  product and service developments. As a result, the
                  producers of those products and service seek to
                  protect their proprietary interest in the underlying
                  information. However, these actions have broader
                  consequences: Attempts to extend legal protection to
                  basic facts and other public domain information
                  demonstrate that the public information space is
                  slowly being reduced. Reviewing several information
                  controversies as case studies is fruitful. Not only
                  for assessing current trends in information disputes
                  (warfare) but can form the basis for establishing
                  several predictors useful in determining when future
                  information ownership controversies may develop and
                  result in the loss of public information space. One
                  set of predictors helps define the information
                  controversy and is descriptive. The second set of
                  predictors characterizes the marketplace
                  environment. It provides further nuance to the
                  economic factors that force information owners to
                  seek legal remedy. Identifying instances where both
                  models suggest a change in information rights or
                  ownership is most likely to result in the critical
                  loss of access to public information space.},

                  Pirate Utopias, and it's hard to argue otherwise
                  after reading it. Deliberately freeing the volume
                  from the shackles of academic rigor (and jargon),
                  Ludlow draws deeply from the cyber-underground and
                  mixes classic rants with post-millennial
                  realism. From John Perry Barlow's chestnut "A
                  Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace" to
                  Jedediah Purdy's cautionary "The God of the
                  Digerati," the collection is direct,
                  confrontational, and thought-provoking. Though the
                  topic of virtual communities has been thoroughly
                  explored elsewhere, the possibility of spaces free
                  from terrestrial jurisdiction--called "Temporary
                  Autonomous Zones" by Hakim Bey--has not yet
                  penetrated mainstream thought. Strong encryption and
                  essential qualities of the Internet--like
                  portability--ensure that such utopias will remain
                  theoretically and practically tenable through the
                  foreseeable future, and Ludlow's visionaries want to
                  see them flower. The penultimate section on
                  experimental governing systems and the appended
                  interview with Noam Chomsky demolishing widely held
                  beliefs about anarchy crown the book with deep
                  thinking about issues vital to the future of
                  freedom--online and off. It's exciting to see this
                  work get the widespread attention it deserves--with
                  any luck, the iconic Net user will soon trade in the

  Abstract =	 {Based on a survey of the diverse institutions
                  various industries have cultivated to handle
                  intellectual property transactions, Merges contends
                  that ``repeat players'' (individuals and firms that
                  frequently need to exchange rights) can and often do
                  take steps to overcome transactional
                  bottlenecks. Whether through copyright collectives,
                  such as ASCAP and BMI in the music industry, or
                  undertakings such as patent pools in automobile and
                  aircraft manufacturing, those with a recurring need
                  to transact in intellectual property rights invest
                  in administrative structures that lower the costs of
                  exchanging rights. Among other functions, these
                  collective rights organizations promulgate rules and
                  procedures for placing a monetary value on members'
                  property rights. They thus conserve on transaction
                  costs either by making it easier to identify and
                  locate rightholders, or by creating the occasion for
                  repeat-play, reciprocal bargaining, versus more
                  costly one- shot exchanges, Drawing on a body of
                  academic literature known as the new institutional
                  economics, Professor Merges explains and analyzes
                  the origins and operation of these
                  organizations. Professor Merges applies his
                  observations and theoretical insights to an
                  important contemporary controversy: whether Congress
                  ought to legislate a compulsory license for digital
                  content needed by the multimedia industry. He argues
                  that it should not. Given the underlying economics,
                  and consistent with experience in other industries,
                  existing intellectual property rights will force
                  industry participants to invest in institutions to
                  conduct transactions. Indeed, consistent with the
                  analysis in this Article, evidence indicates this is
                  already occurring.},

                  players and precise historical data (Linux kernel
                  releases are dated to the second), it traces "free
                  software" from its early '80s origin--with Robert [sic] 
                  Stallman's founding of the GNU Project--and takes it
                  as far as the end of 2000--with GNU/Linux becoming a
                  worldwide phenomenon that runs handheld PDAs, PCs
                  and Macs, IBM mainframes, and the world's biggest
                  supercomputers. Glyn Moody charts every milestone in
                  the development of the Linux kernel, from Linus
                  Torvalds's first installation of Minix. As
                  importantly, he follows the progress of major "free
                  software" projects (essential to the success of
                  GNU/Linux) from Emacs and GCC to Sendmail and XFree
                  86, and finishes with KDE and Gnome. The end result
                  is a curiously exciting and compulsively readable
                  tale that compares with Tracy Kidder's book, The

  OPTNote =	 {JAN CALIF LAW REV},
  Abstract =	 {Article 2B of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)
                  provides model rules to govern transactions in the
                  digital domain, such as the licensing of software
                  and electronic contracting. By addressing
                  fundamental contract issues in the burgeoning world
                  of digital commerce, it provides a salutary update
                  to extant provisions of the U.C.C, dealing with
                  traditional goods sold in traditional modes of
                  commerce. However, to the extent that Article 2B
                  aspires to protect copyright owners from improper
                  uses of copyrighted works, it solves a
                  non-problem. Copyright owners already enjoy robust
                  and adequate protections under the Copyright
                  Act. Far more troubling than solving this non-
                  problem, however, is the possibility that Article 2B
                  will be used to upset copyright law's "delicate
                  balance" between the rights of copyright owners and
                  copyright users. This balance is disrupted when
                  state law is permitted to enlarge the rights that
                  copyright owners enjoy. Attempts to alter the
                  "delicate balance" through contract should fail
                  under the doctrine of preemption. Article 2B assumes
                  a pose of neutrality on the extent to which
                  copyright Law preempts contractual encroachment, yet
                  it facilitates emerging practices designed to alter
                  the balance and place the burden of defending the
                  proper bounds of copyright on copyright users. In
                  this Article, the authors argue that if Article 2B
                  is to be enacted, it must proscribe contracting
                  practices that seek to extend copyright protection
                  beyond its current scope.},

                  contracts and practices are discussed. Until

                  faculty ownership of the copyright to their courses
                  because there was little money to be made from the
                  courses, beyond funds generated from teaching

                  selling of distance learning courses to large
                  audiences, several universities have shown
                  considerable interest in the ownership of

                  and distributed information resources. In
                  particular, this study compared usability, user
                  preference, effectiveness, and searching behaviors
                  in systems that implement interaction with multiple
                  databases through a common interface, and with
                  multiple databases as if they were one (integrated
                  interaction) in an experiment in the Text REtrieval
                  Conference (TREC) environment, Twenty-eight
                  volunteers were recruited from the graduate students
                  of the School of Communication, Information, \&
                  Library Studies at Rutgers University. Significantly
                  more subjects preferred the common interface to the
                  integrated interface, mainly because they could have
                  more control over database selection. Subjects were
                  also more satisfied with the results from the common
                  interface, and performed better with the common
                  interface than with the integrated
                  interface. Overall, it appears that for this
                  population, interacting with databases through a
                  common interface, is preferable on all grounds to
                  interacting with databases through an integrated
                  interface, These results suggest that: (1) the
                  general assumption of the information retrieval (IR)
                  literature that an integrated interaction is best
                  needs to be revisited; (2) it is important to allow
                  for more user control in the distributed
                  environment; (3) for digital library purposes, it is
                  important to characterize different databases to
                  support user choice for integration; and, (4)
                  certain users prefer control over database selection
                  while still opting for results to be merged.},

                  unprecedented resources to scholars in the

                  objectionable material, eg, pornography, racist
                  propaganda, and instructions for making bombs, to
                  students. Universities are caught in legal and moral
                  conflicts between the First Amendment and free
                  speech and limiting minors' access to
                  pornography. Universities are within their rights to
                  censor morally objectionable material, eg, child
                  pornography, that is not protected by the First
                  Amendment, and to provide access to morally
                  acceptable information protected by the First
                  Amendement, but information in between, especially
                  when minors are involved, is controversial. With
                  input from all stakeholders, universities need to
                  develop procedures to deal with this in-between
                  information, which may involve restricted access to

                  Lessig's ambitious attempt to make sense of the new
                  kinds of legal and regulatory problems that
                  cyberspace presents to us. It is built upon the
                  foundational premise that code-the hardware and
                  software elements that populate this new place, and
                  the communication protocols that allow these
                  elements to interact with one another-defines the
                  architecture of this new space and is of paramount
                  importance in determining how it will be
                  regulated. As an anthropology of the various new
                  regulatory and quasi-regulatory structures that may
                  arise on the global network, Lessig's book is
                  captivating and often dazzling; he demonstrates,
                  compellingly, that cyberspace is a place in which
                  code dominates, a world in which "code is law." As a
                  normative call to arms, however, the book is
                  somewhat less successful. Lessig argues that because
                  we are the code writers-because cyberspace is a
                  made, not a found, world-control over the code needs
                  to be subject to political, collective
                  decisionmaking. Post suggests several reasons why
                  this conclusion might not follow as smoothly from
                  the premise as Lessig might have us believe.},

  Abstract =	 {Considers the usefulness of postmodern theories to
                  an analysis of the relation of the Internet to
                  democracy. It is suggested that the primary
                  difficulties in employing such theories is the
                  inadequate development of a fully postmodern theory
                  of politics and the persistence of democracy, a
                  modern category, as a dominant political norm and
                  ideal. However, despite their limitations,
                  postmodern theories are an excellent starting point
                  for examining cyberdemocracy, if only because the
                  Internet deeply troubles basic assumptions of older
                  positions. One path toward developing a postmodern
                  theory of cyberdemocracy may be developed through
                  the concept of the public sphere. Jurgen Habermas's
                  (1989) Model of the public sphere is rejected in
                  favor of a model that stresses its contentious,
                  gender, fractured nature. Viewed in this manner, the
                  public sphere might be invigorated by the Internet
                  because this technology radically decenters
                  political speech and, thus, opens the possibility of
                  greater cultural negotiation and conflict. The case
                  of gender in Internet communication is discussed as
                  an example of this process. It is concluded that,
                  because the Internet reconfigures the practice of
                  self-constitution in the public sphere, it also
                  allows the reconfiguration of the political
                  itself. 34 References. D. Ryfe},

                  reflects the experience and vision of Jef Raskin,
                  the creator of the Apple Macintosh project. Other
                  books may show how to use today's widgets and
                  interface ideas effectively. Raskin, however,
                  demonstrates that many current interface paradigms
                  are dead ends, and that to make computers
                  significantly easier to use requires new
                  approaches. He explains how to effect desperately
                  needed changes, offering a wealth of innovative and
                  specific interface ideas for software designers,
                  developers, and product managers. The Apple
                  Macintosh helped to introduce a previous revolution
                  in computer interface design, drawing on the best
                  available technology to establish many of the
                  interface techniques and methods now universal in
                  the computer industry. With this book, Raskin proves
                  again both his farsightedness and his
                  practicality. He also demonstrates how design ideas
                  must be built on a scientific basis, presenting just
                  enough cognitive psychology to link the interface of
                  the future to the experimental evidence and to show
                  why that interface will work. Raskin observes that
                  our honeymoon with digital technology is over: We
                  are tired of having to learn huge, arcane programs
                  to do even the simplest of tasks; we have had our
                  fill of crashing computers; and we are fatigued by
                  the continual pressure to upgrade. The Humane
                  Interface delivers a way for computers, information
                  appliances, and other technology-driven products to
                  continue to advance in power and expand their range
                  of applicability, while becoming free of the hassles
                  and obscurities that plague present products. (Jacket)}

                  and Dada to Performance and Installation, were

                  tradition of representing the world visually in

                  provides a fairly comprehensive, though sometimes
                  fluidly categorized, overview of the development of
                  the modern ``aesthetic of technology.'' For Rutsky,
                  technology, once clearly defined as ``other'' than
                  what is human, has perhaps replaced religion and
                  psychology as the main source of metaphors for how
                  the mind (and soul) work. Citing a range of modern
                  philosophers and thinkers from Heidegger, Benjamin
                  and Duchamp to the inevitable William Gibson and the
                  doyenne of cyber-aesthetics, Donna Haraway, the book
                  covers a lot of ground--Shelley's Frankenstein, the
                  constructivist films of Vertov, a reading of William
                  Gibson via Frederic Jameson, a long section on Fritz
                  Lang's film Metropolis and a detour into a theory of
                  Nazism and Hitler fascination as the fervid
                  fetishizing of an androgynous leader. Rutsky falters
                  a bit when it comes to contemporary art and cultural
                  practices, where some fieldwork and reportage would
                  have given his examples more punch. Like George
                  Landow's paean to cyberculture, Hypertext, the book
                  is best on how thinking about technology helps
                  resolve certain philosophical conundrums--organic
                  vs. mechanic; rational vs. irrational; masculine
                  vs. feminine--that have plagued the West, perhaps
                  even providing the ground for a total unified field
                  theory. Lucid and cogent in its presentation of
                  highly complicated issues, this study will reward
                  those interested in the fatal attraction of art and
                  culture. (Cahners Business Information.)}

                  giving individuals property rights in their personal
                  data to promote information privacy in cyberspace. A
                  property rights approach would allow individuals to
                  negotiate with firms about the uses to which they
                  are willing to have personal data put and would
                  force businesses to internalize a higher proportion
                  of the societal costs of personal data
                  processing. However, granting individuals property
                  rights in personal information is unlikely to
                  achieve information privacy goals in part because a

                  instructors to integrate student feedback into the
                  current course structure, thus increasing student
                  participation and motivation for learning; (2)
                  increases course efficiency by reducing student
                  confusion over syllabus modifications; (3) augments

  Abstract =	 {In this Article, Professor Schwartz depicts the
                  widespread silent collection of personal information
                  in cyberspace. At present, it is impossible to know
                  the fate of the personal data that one generates
                  online. Professor Schwartz argues that this state of
                  affairs degrades the health of a deliberative
                  democracy; it cloaks in dark uncertainty the
                  transmutation of Internet activity into personal
                  information that will follow one into other areas
                  and discourage civic participation. This situation
                  also will have a negative impact on individual self-
                  determination by deterring individuals from engaging
                  in the necessary thinking out loud and deliberation
                  with others upon which choice-making depends. In
                  place of the existing privacy horror show on the
                  Internet, Professor Schwartz seeks to develop
                  multidimensional rules that set out fair information
                  practices for personal data in cyberspace. The
                  necessary rules must establish four requirements:
                  (1) defined obligations that limit the use of
                  personal data: (2) transparent processing systems;
                  (3) limited procedural and substantive rights; and
                  (4) external oversight. Neither the market nor
                  industry self- regulation are likely, however, to
                  put these four practices in place. Under current
                  conditions, a failure exists in the "privacy
                  market." Moreover, despite the Clinton
                  Administration's endorsement of industry
                  self-regulation, this method is an unlikely
                  candidate for success. Industry self- regulation of
                  privacy is a negotiation about "the rules of play"
                  for the use of personal data. In deciding on these
                  rules, industry is likely to be most interested in
                  protecting its stream of revenues. Therefore, it
                  will benefit if it develops norms that preserve the
                  current status quo of maximum information
                  disclosure. This Article advocates a legislative
                  enactment of the four fair information
                  practices. This legal expression of privacy norms is
                  the best first step in promoting democratic
                  deliberation and individual self-determination in
                  cyberspace.,Tt will further the attainment of
                  cyberspace's potential as a new realm for
                  collaboration in political and personal
                  activities. Enactment of such a federal law would be
                  a decisive move to shape technology so it will
                  further-and not harm-democratic self-governance.},

                  technology, the Internet and, in turn, the
                  information superhighway have been popularly
                  heralded as having the potential to transform
                  schools the world over, but little critical
                  examination of the information superhighway's role
                  in education has taken place. Here, popular
                  conceptions of the educational superhighway are
                  contrasted with the likely social and cultural
                  implications of the "wired" school. Examined first
                  are three central claims made about the information
                  superhighway in education: (1) the unbridled access
                  to information it will afford teachers and learners;
                  (2) the potential for interactive communication with
                  other individuals; and (1990) The equality it will
                  imbue. These popular discourses are then contrasted
                  with two fundamental characteristics of the
                  information superhighway often overlooked by its
                  advocates: the different quality of learning
                  experienced online and the educational implications
                  of the inherent economic nature of the emerging
                  information superhighway. Suggested in conclusion is
                  an alternative approach to examining the
                  implementation of the information superhighway in an
                  educational context. 51 References. Adapted from the

                  eloquently, offering prescriptions for thoughtful
                  leaders such as limiting certain intellectual

                  repositories and seven universities collaborated on
                  an extensive demonstration project called the Museum
                  Educational Site Licensing Project (MESL) to explore
                  the administrative, technical, and pedagogical
                  issues involved in making digital museum images and
                  information available to educational audiences. This
                  article reviews the MESL pr-eject's methods and
                  findings in a number of areas-descriptive metadata,
                  database design, interface design, and tools for
                  use. It discusses more recent development, efforts
                  in extending the model for digital image delivery of
                  visual resources to higher education audiences,
                  Finally, it suggests how to proceed by posing a
                  number of user-centered questions about the design

                  even an unorthodox one, may sound less than
                  enthralling, but this breezy account of the life of
                  Linux inventor Torvalds not only lives up to its
                  insouciant title, it provides an incisive look into
                  the still-raging debate over open source code. In
                  his own words (interspersed with co-writer Diamond's
                  tongue-in-cheek accounts of his interviews with the
                  absentminded Torvalds), the programmer relates how
                  it all started in 1981 with his grandfather back in
                  Finland, who let him play around on a Vic 20
                  computer. At 11 years old, Torvalds was hooked on
                  computersespecially on figuring out how they ran and
                  on improving their operating systems. For years,
                  Torvalds did little but program, upgrading his
                  hardware every couple of years, attending school in
                  a desultory fashion and generally letting the
                  outside world float by unnoticed, until he
                  eventually wrote his own operating system, Linux. In
                  a radical move, he began sharing the code with
                  fellow OS enthusiasts over the burgeoning Internet
                  in the early 1990s, allowing others to contribute to
                  and improve it, while he oversaw the process. Even
                  though Torvalds is now a bigger star in the computer
                  world than Bill Gates, and companies like IBM are
                  running Linux on their servers, he has retained his
                  innocence: the book is full of statements like "Open
                  source makes sense" and "Greed is never good" that
                  seem sincere. Leavened with an appealing,
                  self-deprecating sense of humor and a generous
                  perspective that few hardcore coders have, this is a
                  refreshing read for geeks and the techno-obsessed.}

                  (1963 [1950]) notion of a psychosocial moratorium to

                  contributes to the construction of a more

                  unitary self, with computer experiences illustrating
                  a decentered identity composed of a multiplicity of

                  many unfortunate and unforeseen consequences. Most
                  of the justifications given for information privacy

                  founded in 1984 by former MIT programmer Richard
                  Stallman, who is seen as an evangelist who believes
                  that software and its documentation should be able
                  to be copied freely and redistributed. In 1991 Linus
                  Torvalds, then a 21-year-old University of Helsinki
                  student and disciple of Stallman, invented Linux, a
                  computer operating system that never crashes, can be
                  rewritten to accommodate various uses, and is
                  available free. Wayner shows how Microsoft has
                  responded to the free software movement and predicts
                  that open source software will eventually beat out
                  proprietary software. Wayner himself is an open
                  source proponent, and at one point he waxes
                  philosophical about wealth and freedom, capturing
                  the essence of the free software movement. -- David

                  way for publishers to verify the authenticity of
                  messages claiming authorization to receive digital
                  works. These technologies have a useful adjunct to
                  trusted systems, which allow content providers to
                  prevent recipients from passing usable copies of the
                  work to anyone who has not paid the content
                  provider, and give content providers flexibility in
                  specifying the nature of the event that will trigger
                  a payment obligation. But their consequences are
                  undesirable: Trusted systems relying on common
                  identifiers will reduce anonymity and informational
                  privacy on the Internet. Some commentators suggest
                  that this concentration of control is a good thing;
                  the price discrimination it enables, they urge, will
                  broaden distribution of information goods. Yet the
                  benefits of such a system are clouded; any increase
                  in distribution due to price discrimination comes at
                  the cost of shutting down distribution that comes,
                  in today's less- controlled system through sharing
                  or secondary markets. It will likely be accompanied
                  by increased media concentration and a
                  self-reinforcing cycle of commercial pressure on
                  individual privacy. In considering these effects, we
                  should remember that they are unnecessary;
                  publishers could get the benefits of trusted systems
                  without relying on common identifiers at all.},

  Abstract =	 {The arrival of digital libraries has necessitated
                  the creation of a new definition of literacy. This
                  author is an inventor of an online reference library
                  service (Electric Library/Homework Helper) and
                  posits that "free-form" learning and information
                  delivered on demand to a scholar is the highest form
                  of new media literacy. This "just in time learning"
                  embodies all of the most popular aspects of
                  twenty-first century literacy as recently defined
                  and debated by educators and librarians. The author
                  surveys recent research and literature on the topic
                  and defines twenty-first century literacy in a new
                  light, expanding on the traditional definition while
                  incorporating a discussion of the Electric Library
                  as it pertains to this new media trend.},

                  interactions to strengthen ties at both the

                  service providers that have been found vicariously
                  liable for copyright infringement. However, by
                  basing this limitation on the absence of the
                  "benefit" and "control" elements of the common law
                  test for vicarious liability, the plain language of
                  Title II, codified at 17 U.S.C. 512, appears to
                  preclude statutory protection once a court has found
                  a service provider vicariously liable. This Comment
                  argues that courts must read a narrow definition of
                  "actual" control into 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(1)(B) in
                  order to preserve the liability limitations of Title
                  II, to avoid structural conflict, and to fulfill
                  legislative intent. This Comment locates actual
                  control in a line of district court cases from the
                  Second Circuit that have been eclipsed by the Ninth
                  Circuit's embrace of "legal" control. This Comment
                  concludes that an actual-control standard best
                  preserves incentives to monitor for infringement.},

  Abstract =	 {This article begins with a premise that intellectual
                  property and privacy have something significant and
                  yet understated in common: both are about balancing
                  a creator's desire to control a particular set of
                  data with consumers desires to access and
                  redistribute that data. Both law and technology
                  influence such balancing, making it more or less
                  palatable to use data for particular
                  purposes-whether one is an individual making a copy
                  of a popular song for a friend, or a hospital
                  selling a list of maternity ward patients to a day
                  care service. In the shadow of the Intetnet's vapid
                  development and concomitant easing of barriers to
                  data sharing, holders of intellectual property are
                  pairing increased legal protection with the
                  technologies of "trusted systems." I describe how
                  these technologies might allow more thorough mass
                  distribution of data, while allowing publishers to
                  retain unprecedented control over their wares. For
                  instance, an e-Book seller might charge one price
                  for a read-only copy that could not be printed or
                  forwarded and charge an additional fee for each copy
                  or printout made. Taking up the case of medical
                  privacy, I then suggest that those who worry about
                  the confidentiality of medical records, particularly
                  as they are digitized by recent congressional
                  mandate, might seek to augment comparatively paltry
                  legal protections with trusted systems
                  technologies. For instance, a trusted system could
                  allow a patient to specify how and by whom her
                  records could be used; within limits, she could
                  allow full access to her primary care physician,
                  while allowing only time- limited access to
                  emergency care providers, non-personally
                  identifiable access to medical researchers, and no
                  access at all for marketing purposes. These
                  technologies could allow for new kinds of privacy
                  protection, without sacrificing the legitimate
                  interests of the consumers of medical records.},

  Abstract =	 {Maintains that the psychoanalytic notion of
                  interpassivity is capable of explaining the
                  potential of digital and Internet technology. The
                  ramifications of cyberspace for the Oedipus complex
                  are considered; differences between simulacrum and
                  appearance are explored to demonstrate that
                  cyberspace foretells the demise of the Oedipus
                  complex. Sigmund Freud's (1989 edition) notion of
                  the primordial father is used in conjunction with
                  the mythical narrative of Oedipus to further examine
                  the historicity of the Oedipus complex. The concept
                  of the Third Father is compared to Jacques Lacan's
                  (3) Treatment of God as nonexistent; it is
                  subsequently asserted that the Other has never
                  existed because the Other is the symbolic
                  order. Noting the emergence of the cultural of
                  complaint, it is claimed that underprivileged
                  individuals who complain to the Other ultimately
                  reconfirm its position. The psychoanalytic
                  conceptualization of perversion is used to engage
                  cyberspace. Despite certain scientific advancements
                  (eg, gene mapping), it is stated that cyberspace
                  permits individuals to access their fantasmatic
                  identities that are otherwise incapable of being
                  subjectivized. It is concluded that such
                  externalization of human fantasies exemplifies
                  Lacan's notion of la traversee du fantasme
                  (traversing fantasy). 31 References. J. W. Parker},
